They don’t just deliver code and finish tasks. 
They also help you refine the vision for upcoming features and changes. 
They are always looking if and how the requirements can be slightly 
changed to reduce the scope of a task, finish it faster and bring 80% of 
the value with 20% of the time. 
That is if you agree with the proposed direction that could save you 
time and budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who’s on our team?
The people behind one of the most popular Ruby on Rails blog 
and the authors of 8 programming books regarding Rails, React.js, DDD, 
and Async/Remote cooperation. We are not ninjas, and gurus. 
But, we are experienced and mindful developers with a wide skillset. 
We can easily work on frontend and backend tasks. 
That gives us the ability to understand the whole application 
faster and introduce changes on all necessary layers. 
Which means we can ship whole features instead of disconnected tasks. 
We love to work towards business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I going to know what you work on today? trnasparency
We practice a technique called over-communication which keeps you 
always in the communication loop. Every day, 
we share with you via email or chat: what we did, 
how we managed to do it, what obstacles we met and the progress towards 
the business objective. That means you are informed and don’t need 
to waste your time on micro-managing our developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you going to leave me for a better-paying client or your 
own product after 4 months?
That’s very unlikely. We are proud of maintaining years-long lasting 
and fruitful relationships with our clients. 
We don’t just jump between projects on every possible occasion. 
We understand that knowing your business is going to take us time and 
we are willing to spend that time on learning the people, the process, 
and the code. Leaving your project after a few months would be a waste 
of the invested time and effort on both sides. So we prefer a stable, 
long-term cooperation. Some of our clients have been with us for 7 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><summary type="html">Our experienced developers always have your business in mind.

Custom software development is the process of design and building software solutions for a specific set of users, functions or organizations. It is also referred to as bespoke software. Custom software helps to increase productivity or address an internal need. It integrates and consolidates data, systems, and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with simple software solution and small chunk of requirements. Once it proves to be valuable and profitable, subsequent extensions of the software is always an option. This apprach is known as lean software development and can be summarized by seven principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminate waste like wrong features and unnecessarily complex solutions.
Amplify learning with short development cycles (sprints) and early validation by end users.
Decide as late as possible. The agile development approach promotes delaying certain crucial decisions until customers have realized their needs better.
Deliver as fast as possible to recognize specific requirements and environment the solutions will be operating in.
Empower the team by letting developers explain what actions might be taken, as well as provide suggestions.
Build integrity in. This could be good communication on requirements and clear acceptance criteria.
Optimize the whole. Custom software is not simply the sum of its parts, but also the product of its interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="services" /><category term="web development" /><category term="mobile development" /><summary type="html">7 Keys to Effective Custom Software Development Custom software development is the process of design and building software solutions for a specific set of users, functions or organizations.

Disruptive innovation, changing business models and increasingly complex technologies present major challenges for small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can your organization keep up with large enterprises? How can you remain competitive and improve your position? We help SMBs with this defining transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft­ware is key to success
We strongly believe that any organization can tap its potential by using the right software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a custom application to stand out from your competitors, to increase the quality of your processes and to boost your through-put. High volumes of data can be visualized and provide valuable insights, and help better understand your clients, employees, and company. Stay up to date through automated notifications whenever there is a problem. Using mobile technologies, your data is available wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our applications often provide a mix of these advantages and give you a competitive edge. Together we can find a way towards this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path to your cus­tom application
We support you and your project from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the initial idea we will analyze your business processes and find potential for optimization. We will design your system, estimate the cost, implement the software, and operate it, safely and reliably. All services are provided from a single source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop
During a one- or two-day workshop we will discuss the processes that are to be optimized through software. We ask numerous questions to discover the most effective path towards this objective. While ideas are being discussed, we directly provide assessments of feasibility and costs.
Detailled cost estimate
Once the workshop concludes we will design mockups of screens we discussed, and prepare a detailed cost estimate. Based on this estimate we will then recommend a budget for the project.
Implementation, discussion of details, testing
During this phase we will implement your application in close cooperation with you. Our agile development process ensures that requirements can be changed at any time. Week by week you can watch the progress of your software on a test system.
Launch and operations
Once developed, your application is ready for use in production. We will provide stable and secure operations, maintain your systems, and continue development – for many years, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="services" /><category term="web development" /><category term="mobile development" /><summary type="html">ap­ping your potential Disruptive innovation, changing business models and increasingly complex technologies present major challenges for small and medium-sized businesses.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/img_17.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Software &amp;amp; Process Auditing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/services-auditing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software &amp; Process Auditing" /><published>2019-01-28T00:00:00-02:00</published><updated>2019-01-28T00:00:00-02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/services-auditing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/services-auditing/">&lt;p&gt;20&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="services" /><category term="web development" /><category term="mobile development" /><summary type="html">20</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/img_20.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hiring Help &amp;amp; Support</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/services-hiring-support/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hiring Help &amp; Support" /><published>2019-01-27T00:00:00-02:00</published><updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00-02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/services-hiring-support</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/services-hiring-support/">&lt;p&gt;23&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="services" /><category term="people" /><summary type="html">23</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/img_23.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How we work</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/how-we-work/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How we work" /><published>2019-01-26T00:00:00-02:00</published><updated>2019-01-26T00:00:00-02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/how-we-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/how-we-work/">&lt;p&gt;245&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="featured" /><category term="process" /><category term="people" /><summary type="html">245</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/img_24.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Where we are</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/where-we-are/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where we are" /><published>2019-01-25T00:00:00-02:00</published><updated>2019-01-25T00:00:00-02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/where-we-are</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/where-we-are/">&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="process" /><category term="people" /><summary type="html">5</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/img_5.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ruby on Rails Services</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/rails/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ruby on Rails Services" /><published>2019-01-24T00:00:00-02:00</published><updated>2019-01-24T00:00:00-02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/rails</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/rails/">&lt;p&gt;25&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>foss</name></author><category term="featured" /><category term="process" /><category term="services" /><category term="web development" /><category term="mobile development" /><summary type="html">25</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/img_25.jpg" /></entry></feed>
