Soft­ware is key to success
We strongly believe that any organization can tap its potential by using the right software.

The path to your cus­tom application
We support you and your project from start to finish.

Starting with the initial idea we will analyze your business processes and find potential for optimization. We will design your system, estimate the cost, implement the software, and operate it, safely and reliably. All services are provided from a single source.

Workshop
During a one- or two-day workshop we will discuss the processes that are to be optimized through software. We ask numerous questions to discover the most effective path towards this objective. While ideas are being discussed, we directly provide assessments of feasibility and costs.
Detailled cost estimate
Once the workshop concludes we will design mockups of screens we discussed, and prepare a detailed cost estimate. Based on this estimate we will then recommend a budget for the project.
Implementation, discussion of details, testing
During this phase we will implement your application in close cooperation with you. Our agile development process ensures that requirements can be changed at any time. Week by week you can watch the progress of your software on a test system.
Launch and operations
Once developed, your application is ready for use in production. We will provide stable and secure operations, maintain your systems, and continue development – for many years, if necessary.
