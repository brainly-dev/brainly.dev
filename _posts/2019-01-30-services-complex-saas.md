SaaS

Software as a Service products is where Lean software development methods shine.
Every SaaS product team, no matter whether it was bootstrapped or just received a round of financing, needs to know how users use their software, where is the most significant value, and what are the features that are often misunderstood. And when the startup starts to gain traction and the attention of more prominent clients, it is of the utmost importance to keep everything running in a fast and stable manner—otherwise, people won’t be able to rely on the software.

We have experience with providing metrics-based, user-friendly and straightforward user interface design for SaaS startups, iterative development using modern backend and frontend frameworks, and making sure the software scales with the number of users and size of data in their accounts.
