The capability to evolve, to iterate, to allow assumptions, to run multiple experiments, and to make changes, is what makes a tech solution to fit and become successful.
We use lean development principles in our projects , and we ship working software as often as possible.

“The design is only good when it converts”

When it comes to the product itself and UI design, we apply our no-nonsense, conversion-based design approach: the design is only good when it converts. Behavior tracking, measuring conversion on every step, and iterating is always a part of the process.

## Agile approach 
Building our development process on Agile principles ensures that our clients are active participants of the whole process.

## Continuous delivery 
Deploying new features as soon as possible help us validate the design, and detect needed change s before they can become a problem. It helps us to enable a process of high transparency for our clients, as well as incrementing value for their users.

## Test driven development 
Applying progressive QA practices at each stage of the development guarantees fewer defects and fixes in future
