# Transparency
Our tools are fully available to our clients, so all of our steps are visible.

# Are you going to leave me for a better-paying client or your own product after 3-4 months?
We don't just jump between projects on every opportunity or possible occasion. Before starting the collaboration we evaluate the project, since we know that would be a waste 
of the invested time and effort on both sides just to leave after a few months without delivering value. Its not ethical and not good to our reputation.
